# QLS-Physics-Club-Resources

## Description

This repository contains the supplemental material that is used by the Quarry Lane Physics Club. Its primary intent is to serve as a reference for students who have yet to take an introductory physics class or have not learned a concept that will be used in a future meeting. It also contains problems that are assigned with the material and discussed during meetings.
