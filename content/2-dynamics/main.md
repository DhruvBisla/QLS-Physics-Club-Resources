# Dynamics

Dynamics is the subset of mechanics that deals with the cause of motion, namely forces. As with the previous, this section makes a handful of assumptions, including: the object in question is idealized (represented as a particle), the motion of this particle is merely translational, and these objects are limited to minute speeds relative to the speed of light.

## Mass/Inertia

**Definition:** The property that defines an object's resistance to a change in its natural state\textemdash rest or uniform linear motion. In this way, mass can be considered to be a qualitative measure of inertia.

**Units:** kg $\rightarrow$ $\SI{1}{\kg}$

## Newton's First Law/Law of Inertia

**Definition:** Bodies remain at rest or uniform linear motion as long as there is an absence of a net applied force.

## Force

**Definition** The environmental action that produces an acceleration.

**Units:** md/tÂ² or N $\rightarrow$ $\SI{1}{\kg\mpss}$ or $\SI{1}{N}$

Force is defined as a vector, as it includes information about direction and magnitude. 

## Newton's Second Law

**Equation:**

<!-- $$\Sigma\vec{F} = m\vec{a} = m(\vcompx{a}\ihat + \vcompy{a}\jhat)$$ -->

Or, split into (2 for 2D) scalar equations:

<!-- $$\Sigma\vcompx{F} = m\vcompx{a}, \Sigma\vcompy{F} = m\vcompy{a}$$ -->

Note that this is not a relation between *a* force and an object's acceleration. Instead, it is the relationship between the *net* force, or the sum of all forces on the object, and the acceleration of that object.

Also notice that Newton's Second Law offers a more general form of Newton's First Law: consider the case where the net force on an object is zero. Then, for a non-zero mass, the object's acceleration must be zero, indicating that it is either at rest or travelling at constant velocity.

Finally, the proportionality in this equation has the following, often useful, consequence:

$$\Sigma\vec{F_1} = \Sigma\vec{F_2} \Longleftrightarrow m_1\vec{a_1} = m_2\vec{a_2} \Longleftrightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{\vec{a_1}}{\vec{a_2}}$$

## Newton's Third Law
